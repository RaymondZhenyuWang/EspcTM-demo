# EspcTM-demo
An demo for the paper "EspcTM: Kinetic Transition Network based on Trajectory Mapping in Effective Energy Rescaling Space".
"rama_all.xvg" is filename of the dihedral angles data. In this demo, Ala12 has 10 pairs of dihedral angles. 
In "rama_all.xvg", it has two columns, the first colum is Phi and the second is Psi.
"Scale_all.xvg" is filename of the potential energy data. And it also has two columns, the first colum is frame index and the second is energy value.
"EspcTM-demo.ipynb" is the code writen by Jupyter Notebook.
